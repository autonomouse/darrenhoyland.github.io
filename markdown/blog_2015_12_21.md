I've decided to start keeping a blog again, and the very first decision is what to use to host it.

Somehow, it doesn't feel right using blogger or medium or one of those, and I like the flexibility of markdown and keeping stuff in a git repository. Life's too short for elaborate, one-man, self-hosted computer wizardry which I'll forget how I implemented in T minus 3 seconds, so I have opted for the eyebrow-rasingly-named [Strapdown](https://github.com/arturadib/strapdown) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Simple.

Simple is good. Especially when I have very little doubt that I'll end up changing my mind by next week.
